# Movie-Recomdation-System

# Project Overview

In this project, I examined a dataset and then shared the results. To simplify the study, I utilised the Python packages NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. This data collection includes user reviews and box office figures for 10,000 films that were gathered from The Movie Database (TMDb). Multiple values are contained in some columns, such as "cast" and "genres," and they are separated by pipe (|) characters. The connected movie's budget and earnings are displayed in the final two columns that conclude in "_adj," taking inflation into account.



# The following libraries are also required, along with a Python installation:

1) pandas
2) NumPy
3) Matplotlib
4) csv

# What issues did I look into?

What is the number of movies released each year?
How long are the movies?
What is the average budget and revenue for the movies?
What is the relationship between movie budget and revenue?
How many movies in each genre?
What is the most profitable movie?


# Findings

I found a strong positive correlation between budget and revenue. Over the years, the income has consistently exceeded the allocated amount. The most popular genres are drama and comedy, as evidenced by the number of films in each category.
